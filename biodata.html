Depp had no film releases in the next two years, except a brief cameo in ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' (1991), the sixth installment in the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' franchise. He appeared in three films in 1993. In the romantic comedy ''[[Benny and Joon]]'', he played an eccentric and illiterate silent film fan who befriends a mentally ill woman and her brother; it became a [[sleeper hit]]. [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Depp "may look nothing like [[Buster Keaton]], but there are times when he genuinely seems to become the Great Stone Face, bringing Keaton's mannerisms sweetly and magically to life".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/movies/review-film-he-s-his-sister-s-keeper-and-what-a-job-that-is.html | title=He's His Sister's Keeper, and What a Job That Is | work=[[The New York Times]] | author-link=Janet Maslin | first=Janet | last=Maslin | date=April 16, 1993 | access-date=September 29, 2011 | archive-date=May 26, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526091905/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/movies/review-film-he-s-his-sister-s-keeper-and-what-a-job-that-is.html | url-status=live }}</ref> Depp received a second Golden Globe nomination for the performance.

In 1994, Depp reunited with Burton, playing the title role in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', a biographical film about one of history's most inept film directors. Depp later said that he was depressed about films and filmmaking at the time, but that "within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed".<ref name="Arnold, Gary">{{cite news |last=Arnold |first=Gary |title=Depp sees promise in cult filmmaker Ed Wood's story |work=The Washington Times |date=October 2, 1994}}</ref> He found that the role gave him a "chance to stretch out and have some fun" and that working with [[Martin Landau]], who played [[Bela Lugosi]], "rejuvenated my love for acting".<ref name="Arnold, Gary" /> Although it did not earn back its production costs, ''Ed Wood'' received a positive reception from critics, with Maslin writing that Depp had "proved himself as an established, certified great actor" and "captured all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny ability to look at the silver lining of any cloud".<ref>{{cite news |first = Janet |last = Maslin |author-link = Janet Maslin |title = Film Festival Review; Ode to a Director Who Dared to Be Dreadful |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = September 23, 1994}}</ref> Depp was nominated for a third time for a Best Musical or Comedy Actor Golden Globe for his performance.{{citation needed|date=September 2024}}

The next year, Depp starred in three films. He played opposite [[Marlon Brando]] in the box-office hit ''[[Don Juan DeMarco]]'', as a man who believes he is [[Don Juan]], the world's greatest lover. He starred in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Dead Man]]'', a [[Western (genre)|Western]] shot entirely in black-and-white; it was not a commercial success and had mixed critical reviews. And in the financial and critical failure ''[[Nick of Time (film)|Nick of Time]]'', Depp played an accountant who is told to kill a politician to save his kidnapped daughter.

In 1997, Depp and [[Al Pacino]] starred in the crime drama ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]'', directed by [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]]. Depp played [[Joseph D. Pistone]], an undercover FBI agent who assumes the name Donnie Brasco to infiltrate [[American Mafia|the Mafia]] in New York City. To prepare, Depp spent time with Pistone, on whose memoirs the film was based.

Depp appeared in three films in 1999. The first was the sci-fi thriller ''[[The Astronaut's Wife]]'', co-starring [[Charlize Theron]], which was not a commercial or critical success. The second, [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[The Ninth Gate]]'', starred Depp as a seller of old books who becomes entangled in a mystery.

The third was Burton's [[Sleepy Hollow (film)|adaptation]] of ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'', where Depp played [[Ichabod Crane]] opposite [[Christina Ricci]] and [[Christopher Walken]]. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Roddy McDowall]] and [[Basil Rathbone]], saying he "always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl".{{sfn|Burton|Salisbury|2006|pp=177–178}}<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Johnny Depp on playing Ichabod Crane in ''Sleepy Hollow'' |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |date=May 2007 |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20039648,00.html#20056052 |access-date=December 25, 2007 |archive-date=July 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704025641/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20039648,00.html#20056052 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Sleepy Hollow'' was a commercial and critical success.{{citation needed|date=September 2024}}

They signified not just a different kind of celebrity, but a different kind of masculinity: desirable but gentle, manly but girlish. Depp in particular was the cool pinup it was safe to like, and the safe pinup it was cool to like. We fans understood that there was more to Depp, Phoenix and Reeves than handsomeness. They were artistic—they had bands!—and they thought really big thoughts, which they would ramble on about confusingly in interviews. If we dated them, we understood that our role would be to understand their souls.<ref name="Freeman2"/>}}

Similarly, film scholar Anna Everett has described Depp's 1990s films and public persona as "anti-macho" and "gender-bending", going against the conventions of a Hollywood leading man.<ref name="Everett2" /> After ''21 Jump Street'', Depp chose to work in independent films, often taking on quirky roles that sometimes even completely obscured his looks, such as ''Edward Scissorhands''.<ref name="Freeman2" /><ref name="Everett2" /> Critics often described Depp's characters as "iconic loners"<ref name="moviesonline">{{cite web|work=MoviesOnline |title=Interview: Johnny Depp |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_9211.html |access-date=July 3, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705061408/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_9211.html |archive-date=July 5, 2006}}</ref> or "gentle outsiders".<ref name="Everett2" /> According to Depp, his onetime agent, [[Tracey Jacobs]] of [[United Talent Agency]] (UTA), had to take "a lot of heat over the years" for his role choices; Depp characterized higher-ups at UTA as thinking, "Jesus Christ! When does he do a movie where he kisses the girl? When does he get to pull a gun out and shoot somebody? When does he get to be a man for a change? When is he finally going to do a blockbuster?".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tyrangiel|first=Josh|date=March 9, 2004|title=Doing It Depp's Way|language=en-US|magazine=Time|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040315-598528,00.html|access-date=March 15, 2021|issn=0040-781X|archive-date=December 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225090515/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040315-598528,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Everett, his "rule-breaking" roles matched with the "much publicized rebelliousness, unconventionality, and volatility ascribed to Depp's own personal life throughout the decade. From reports of his repeated confrontations with the police, trashing of a hotel room, chain smoking, drinking, and drug use, to his multiple engagements to such glamorous women as supermodel Kate Moss and Hollywood starlet Winona Ryder and others, we clearly see a perfect fit between his non-conformist star image and his repertoire of outsider characters".<ref name="Everett2" />

After a decade of appearing mainly in independent films with varying commercial success, Depp became one of the biggest box-office draws in the 2000s with his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]' ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' franchise.<ref name="Lennard">{{cite book |last1= Lennard|first1= Dominic |editor1-last= Pomerance |editor1-first= Murray |chapter=Wonder Boys – Matt Damon, Johnny Depp and Robert Downey Jr. |title= Shining in Shadows: Movie Stars of the 2000s |year= 2012 |publisher= Rutgers University Press }}</ref> The five films in the series have earned US$4.5 billion as of 2021. In addition to the ''Pirates'' franchise, Depp also made four further films with Tim Burton that were major successes, with one, ''Alice in Wonderland'' (2010), becoming the biggest commercial hit of Depp's career and one of the highest-grossing films in history (as of 2021).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aliceinwonderland10.htm |title=Alice in Wonderland |website=Box Office Mojo |access-date=August 21, 2013 |archive-date=February 18, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218045346/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aliceinwonderland10.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2012, Depp was one of the world's biggest film stars,<ref name="Labrecque">{{cite magazine|last=Labrecque|first=Jeff|date=June 8, 2012|title=Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, and the state of the modern Movie Star|url=https://ew.com/article/2012/06/08/johnny-depp-will-smith-movie-star-2012/|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=December 11, 2019|archive-date=March 31, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331005013/https://ew.com/article/2012/06/08/johnny-depp-will-smith-movie-star-2012/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="NBC4 Washington">{{cite web|title=Johnny Depp May Now Be The Biggest Movie Star Of All Time|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/blogs/popcornbiz/Johnny-Depp-May-Now-Be-The-Biggest-Movie-Star-Of-All-Time-94928899.html|work=NBC4 Washington|date=May 26, 2010 |access-date=July 27, 2014|archive-date=May 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522111117/https://www.nbcwashington.com/blogs/popcornbiz/Johnny-Depp-May-Now-Be-The-Biggest-Movie-Star-Of-All-Time-94928899.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and was listed by the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75&nbsp;million in a year.<ref name="Guinness">{{cite web |last=Erenza |first=Jen |title=Justin Bieber, Miranda Cosgrove, & Lady Gaga Are Welcomed Into 2012 Guinness World Records |url=http://ryanseacrest.com/2011/09/14/justin-bieber-miranda-cosgrove-lady-gaga-are-welcomed-into-2012-guinness-world-records/ |publisher=RyanSeacrest.com |access-date=September 16, 2011 |date=September 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925171516/http://ryanseacrest.com/2011/09/14/justin-bieber-miranda-cosgrove-lady-gaga-are-welcomed-into-2012-guinness-world-records/ |archive-date=September 25, 2011}}</ref>

According to film scholar Murray Pomerance, Depp's collaboration with Disney "can be seen to purport and herald a new era for Johnny Depp, one in which he is, finally, as though long-promised and long-expected, the proud proprietor of a much-accepted career; not only a star but a middle-class hero".<ref name="Lennard" /> In 2003, the same year as the first film in the ''Pirates'' series was released, Depp was named "World's Sexiest Man" by ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''; he would receive the title again in 2009.<ref name="Lennard" /> During the decade and into the 2010s, Depp was one of the biggest and most popular film stars in the world<ref name="Labrecque" /><ref name="NBC4 Washington" /> and was named by public vote as "Favorite Male Movie Star" at the [[People's Choice Awards]] every year for 2005 through 2012. In 2012, Depp became the highest-paid actor in the American film industry, earning as high as $75 million per film,<ref name="Guinness" /> and as of 2020, is the tenth highest-grossing actor worldwide, with his films having [[gross (economics)|grossed]] over US$3.7 [[billion]] at the United States box office and over US$10 billion worldwide.<ref name="The Numbers">{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-star-records/worldwide/lifetime-acting/top-grossing-leading-stars|title=Top 100 Stars in Leading Roles at the Worldwide Box Office|work=The Numbers|access-date=November 4, 2018|archive-date=November 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104125958/https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-star-records/worldwide/lifetime-acting/top-grossing-leading-stars|url-status=live}}</ref> Although a mainstream favorite with the audiences, critics' views on Depp changed in the 2000s, becoming more negative as he was seen to conform more to the Hollywood ideal.<ref name="Lennard" /> Regardless, Depp continued to eschew more traditional leading-man roles until towards the end of the 2000s, when he starred as John Dillinger in ''Public Enemies'' (2009).<ref name="Lennard" />

In the 2010s, Depp's films were less successful, with many big-budget studio films such as ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'' (2012), ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (2013), and ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'' (2016) underperforming at the box office.<ref name="Variety16" /><ref name="LAT_2012" /><ref name="deadline2013" /><ref name="deadline2014" /> Depp also received negative publicity due to allegations of domestic violence, substance abuse, poor on-set behavior and the loss of his US$650 million fortune.<ref name="trouble">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/the-trouble-with-johnny-depp-666010/|title=The Trouble With Johnny Depp|first=Stephen|last=Rodrick|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 21, 2018|access-date=March 15, 2021|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308194405/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/the-trouble-with-johnny-depp-666010/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/06/johnny-depp-rolling-stone-650m-film-fortune-almost-all-gone-report-1202415197/|title=Johnny Depp's $650M Film Fortune "Almost All Gone", New Rolling Stone Exposé Says|first=Greg|last=Evans|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=June 21, 2018|access-date=March 15, 2021|archive-date=March 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210326084923/https://deadline.com/2018/06/johnny-depp-rolling-stone-650m-film-fortune-almost-all-gone-report-1202415197/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/johnny-depp-a-star-crisis-insane-story-his-missing-millions-1001513|title=Johnny Depp: A Star in Crisis and the Insane Story of His "Missing" Millions|first1=Stephen|last1=Galloway|first2=Ashley|last2=Cullins|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 10, 2017|access-date=March 15, 2021|archive-date=February 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210218044124/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/johnny-depp-a-star-crisis-insane-story-his-missing-millions-1001513|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Variety2019">{{cite magazine|first=Jordan|last=Moreau|title=Amber Heard Claims Johnny Depp Threatened to Kill Her During Years of Abuse|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/amber-heard-johnny-depp-abuse-threatened-kill-1203187472/|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|location=Los Angeles, California|access-date=April 19, 2019|date=April 11, 2019|archive-date=March 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210321205513/https://variety.com/2019/film/news/amber-heard-johnny-depp-abuse-threatened-kill-1203187472/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Freeman2" /> After losing a highly publicized libel trial against the publishers of ''The Sun'', Depp was asked to resign from Warner Bros.'

{{blockquote|We do not accept that there is any ground for believing that the judge may have been influenced by any such general perception as [Depp's lawyer] relies on. In the first place, he does not refer to [Heard's] charitable donation at all in the context of his central findings. On the contrary, he only mentions it in a very particular context... and after he had already reached his conclusions in relation to the 14 incidents... It is clear from a reading of the judgment as a whole that the judge based his conclusions on each of the incidents on his extremely detailed review of the evidence specific to each incident. ... In an approach of that kind there was little need or room for the judge to give weight to any general assessment of Ms. Heard’s credibility... we conclude that the appeal has no real prospect of success.}}

In August 2022, Depp and Jeff Beck were accused of stealing an incarcerated African American man's poem by incorporating its verses into the lyrics to their song "Sad Motherfuckin' Parade" in their 2022 collaborative album, ''[[18 (Jeff Beck and Johnny Depp album)|18]]''. [[Bruce Jackson (scholar)|Bruce Jackson]], the [[folklore|folklorist]] who made the accusation, requested that Depp and Beck give due credit to Slim Wilson, the actual originator of the lyrics, for the song.

In November 2016, Depp joined the campaign Imprisoned for Art to call for the release of Ukrainian filmmaker [[Oleg Sentsov]], who was being held in custody in Russia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/johnny-depp-supports-ukrainian-director-oleg-sentsov-imprisoned-art-campaign-948212 |title=Johnny Depp Supports Ukrainian Director Oleg Sentsov in "Imprisoned for Art" Campaign |website=The Hollywood Reporter |first=Vladimir |last=Kozlov |date=November 17, 2016 |access-date=February 18, 2019 |archive-date=February 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219015618/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/johnny-depp-supports-ukrainian-director-oleg-sentsov-imprisoned-art-campaign-948212 |url-status=live }}</ref>

At the [[Glastonbury Festival 2017]], Depp, criticizing President [[Donald Trump]], asked: "When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? I want to clarify: I'm not an actor. I lie for a living. However, it's been a while and maybe it's time. I'm not insinuating anything." The comment was interpreted as a reference to [[John Wilkes Booth]], the actor who [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated Abraham Lincoln]]. Shawn Holtzclaw of the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] told CNN they were aware of Depp's comment, but that "for security reasons, we cannot discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods of how we perform our protective responsibilities".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/22/entertainment/johnny-depp-trump-comment-glastonbury/index.html |title=Johnny Depp: 'When was the last time an actor assassinated a President?' |first=Madison |last=Park |author2=Lisa Respers France |work=[[CNN]] |date=June 23, 2017 |access-date=June 23, 2017 |archive-date=June 23, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623133607/http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/22/entertainment/johnny-depp-trump-comment-glastonbury/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/johnny-depp-when-was-the-last-time-an-actor-assassinated-a-president-w489433|title=Johnny Depp: 'When Was the Last Time an Actor Assassinated a President?'|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Ryan|last=Reed|date=June 23, 2017|access-date=September 2, 2017|archive-date=August 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827060549/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/johnny-depp-when-was-the-last-time-an-actor-assassinated-a-president-w489433|url-status=live}}</ref> Depp apologized shortly afterward, saying the remark "did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice".<ref>{{cite web |last=Stedman |first=Alex |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/johnny-depp-trump-assassination-apology-1202477242/ |title=Johnny Depp Apologizes for Donald Trump Assassination Joke |date=June 23, 2017 |work=Variety |access-date=June 24, 2017 |archive-date=June 23, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623204411/http://variety.com/2017/film/news/johnny-depp-trump-assassination-apology-1202477242/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
